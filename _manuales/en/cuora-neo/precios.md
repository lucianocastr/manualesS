To make a sale, it is necessary to set a price. The equipment includes a great variety of ways you can do this operation.

{: .alert-message .note}
REMEMBER: To speed the operation at the moment of the sale, you can operate multiple price lists that can meet your needs (for example, week's special offers, wholesaler, retailer, etc.)

{: .alert-message .warning}
IMPORTANT: to use this option you must previously create the price lists that you may require and link the products to them.

At [Menu - CRUD's - Prices](../altas-bajas-modificaciones/index.html#precios "Menu - CRUD's - PLU")- you will find the necessary steps to create, edit, or delete a price list.

##### The price can be set manually.
 This procedure that is generally used when the product has not been previously uploaded in the scale or when it is necessary to change the price due to a specific situation.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Enter the item's price to be sold using the numeric keypad (using the comma): Example **12,50**

{: .img-capture}
![Enter the price using the numeric keypad](../../../../images/en/cuora-neo/cuora-neo-manual1.png "Enter the price using the numeric keypad")	

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Press the key <span class="systel-tecla-28"><span class="path1"></span><span class="path2"></span><span class="path3"></span><span class="path4"></span></span>.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Then press <i class="systel-tecla-30 bg-2"></i>.

As the price was set manually and the equipment does not know which article it corresponds to, the item will be identified as UNIT.

##### The price can be set when generating a PLU. 

When creating a PLU, among the setting actions you will find the product's price assignment. You will find the necessary steps to execute this operation at: [Menu - CRUD's - PLU](../altas-bajas-modificaciones/index.html#precios "Menu - CRUD's - PLU")

##### The price can be modified from the price list.

Press the menu key <i class="systel-tecla-1 bg-3"></i>, select a user and enter the password, and then the option **Price Assistant**

{: .img-capture}
![Pre-existent Price List](../../../../images/en/cuora-neo/cuora-neo-lista0.png "Pre-existent Price' List") 

From this point on it is possible to modify the prices of a pre-existent price list.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Select Mass modification of prices. 

{: .img-capture}
![Mass Modification](../../../../images/en/cuora-neo/cuora-neo-lista1.png "Mass Modification")

Select the price list you want to modify by selecting the search option.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Select the department by selecting the search option.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Select the group by selecting the search option.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}

If you opt for "Modify all the prices" you will only see the operation made confirmation message on the screen.

##### Using different prices for the same product 

When a PLU is convened by any of the previously detailed options, the scale will always show the **PRICE LIST 1**.

##### Manual occasional assignment of price for a PLU 

If for any reason you will need to make a change in the price of the product immediately, as by assigning a new value at the moment of the sale, simply convene the article and press the key <span class="systel-tecla-28"><span class="path1"></span><span class="path2"></span><span class="path3"></span><span class="path4"></span></span>

{: .img-capture}
![Assigning an eventual price](../../../../images/en/cuora-neo/cuora-neo-asignar1.png "Assigning an eventual price")

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Then enter the product's price in the numeric keypad

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Press <i class="systel-tecla-30 bg-2"></i> <br>The price field and the one corresponding to the total will be corrected.<br>On the set field to select the price list you will see the word "Manual"

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Press again <i class="systel-tecla-30 bg-2"></i> to change the sale.

##### Product with an open price 

Remember that if any of the prices from the list is left open (Price = 0), the scale will ask you to enter it manually at the moment of the sale.
 
Example: If a product had a **LIST 2 PRICE = $0,00** when convening the PLU, the **LIST 1 PRICE** will be shown, and by pressing **PRICE**, it will allow for the manual assignation of a momentary price since it could not find the loaded price in the **LIST 2**.

##### Discount percentage

The application of a discount on a product can be done in several ways.
 One of them is using the Price Assistant. From this option, you can apply discounts in general or for a particular item; and you can choose the cost reduction of a product by percentage or fixed amount.
 

{: .alert-message .note}
The steps to use this option can be found at [Menu - Price Assistant](../asistente-para-modificacion-de-precios/index.html " Price Assistant")

Apply discount immediately:

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Convene the item and press the key <i class="systel-tecla-18"></i><br>In this option you can assign a discount on the product only by percentage.

{: .img-capture}
![Product's cost reduction only by percentage](../../../../images/en/cuora-neo/cuora-neo-descuento1.png "Product's cost reduction only by percentage")

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}

{: .img-capture}
