When you turn off the scale the data registered will be saved and your settings will be available when you turn it on again.
 
After plugging in the equipment to the power source, you will only need to press the key <i class="systel-tecla-4 bg-3" /> to turn it on.

Once this action has been done, the equipment will automatically adjust itself to the Zero reference point (this can take a few seconds).

Once this operation has been finished, the scale will be ready to be used.
It is important that the equipment is stable during this process. If you touch the platter, the process will start again.
To turn it off press and hold the key <i class= "systel-tecla-4 bg-3"/> , until you see the turned off sign and confirmation sound.
