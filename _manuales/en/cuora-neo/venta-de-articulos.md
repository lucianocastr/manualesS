##### Automatic printing of labels. Pre-Packed Mode

The **Pre-Packed Mode** is used to label several products of the same type with a same **PLU** successively, with the minimum intervention from the user.

This mode presents the advantage of keeping the last selected active PLU, so that you only have to place the products on the platter so that the scale will print the label (weighable products).

Moreover, it is important to highlight that the pre-packed mode can be used to label products that are heavy away from the clients' view (for example, pre-packed products that are placed in the shelves).


**Operating mode.**

Press <i class="systel-tecla-3"></i> to activate the **PRE-PACKED** function.
Then, verify on the screen that the function is activated.

**Pre-packed for a weighable product**:

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Select the product.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Place the product, once it is stable the printing will be printed.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Remove the product, place a different product and a new label will be printed.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Repeat the action as many times as necessary.



**Pre-packed for a non-weighable product**

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
Select the product.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
The label will be automatically printed.

{: .item-step  .mdl-cell--12-col}
To print more labels press the key <i class= "systel-tecla-30 bg-2"></i> as many times as necessary or choose a new product.

{: .alert-message .note}
REMEMBER: The **pre-packed mode** is only available for the printing of labels.

##### Sale of products on ticket mode

The **ticket mode** is conceived to make the sale of several products and that the total is printed in only one receipt.

In one ticket, you can see the commercialization of weighable, non-weighable or multiplied non-weighable products.
