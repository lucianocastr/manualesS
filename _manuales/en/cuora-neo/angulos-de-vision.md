The Cuora NEO Scale uses energy-efficient liquid crystal displays (TFT).
To optimize the visualization of the equipment, during installation, you must take into account that this kind of display has an optimum viewing cone, and the image will lose sharpness and contrast outside its range.
Take into account this characteristic for the equipment's installation, since outside said angle visualization will be poor.
