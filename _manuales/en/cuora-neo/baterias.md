The Cuora Neo Scale is equipped with two internal rechargeable batteries of 12V 2,3Ah each, which in case of a power cut, they allow you to keep working (not available in all models).
It is advisable to use the batteries only in the event of a power cut.
Using the equipment on battery mode on an ongoing basis will significantly shorten the batteries' service life.

##### Battery replacement
To replace the batteries, proceed as follows:

1. Remove the platter.

To recharge the batteries, the scale needs to be connected to the power source, while you can use the scale at the same time. The recharge process will be faster if it is done when the scale is turned off (approximately 12 hs.). Once the recharging is finished, and in order to preserve the batteries, this process is automatically suspended.

{: .alert-message .warning}
To use the equipment for the first time, charge the batteries beforehand by connecting it to the power source, for at least 24 continuous hours. That will assure the batteries' optimum performance.
Make sure the equipment stays turned off while carrying out this task.

##### Recommendations

- It is advised to charge the batteries, before these are discharged up to their minimum capacity. This will assure batteries' longer service life.

- If the batteries get discharged up to their minimum level (See batteries' status), charge them immediately.

{: .alert-message .warning}
If the battery has reached its minimum capacity, the scale will automatically be turned off, to restart it, you must connect it to the power source.

{: .alert-message .warning}
To extend the batteries' service life, make sure to recharge the equipment in case you haven't used it for over a week.  

- The equipment must be turned off and disconnected from the power source before replacing the batteries.
- You must replace the batteries for ones of the same type and capacity (12V - 2,3Ah sealed lead-acid batteries).
- The batteries can be recycled. Get in contact with your local code to get information about their recycling process.
- Do not throw them to the fire. They can explode.
- Do not open or deform them. The loose electrolyte is corrosive and can damage eyes or the skin. It can be toxic if it is ingested.
- Do not clean with petrochemicals and do not expose the clamps to a short-circuit.

{: .alert-message .warning}
Remember the batteries are only meant for occasional use. Their continuous use will severely degrade their service life.
