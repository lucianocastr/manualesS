SUGGESTION: first, complete the parameters that are located after the access to **PLU**, since they contain the data that can be associated after the setting up, thus speeding the process of setting up.

The following image represents the beginning of each subsection, which will be filled out with corresponding data. You can use it to select a preloaded item, or to create a new one.

{: .mdl-cell-nospacing}
<div class="menu-abm-plu-sprites-0013-capa-1"></div>

{: .mdl-cell-nospacing .mdl-cell--12-col}
In this option you can set and/or modify the information linked to every item (or PLU) and to assign the direct access' keys to the most frequently used products.

This module is made up of 6 tabs: 

- Data
- Prices
- Advanced
- Bar code
- Dates
- Auditing

{: .img-capture}
![PLU tabs](../../../../images/en/cuora-neo/cuora-neo-abm-plu.png "PLU tabs")

We will first start by detailing the function that every tab fulfills and the description of the fields that comprise them.

- **Data**: PLU's basic information.
- **Code**: there are three ways to codify a product
  -PLU's code: It is generated by the user in the scale
  -ERP: related to each company
- **Name**: it is what the product is called
- **Description**: brief text that allows you to identify the product by some specific detail.
- **Selling mode**: The way in which the product is commercialized: by the unit or by weight.
- **Department**: sector the product belongs to
- **Group**: set of items grouped in some category.
- **Price modification**: it allows you to cancel or enable temporarily the price adjustment for an item.
- **Advertisement**: message that you can see on the screen before selling an item. It can fulfill the function of a specific notification or reminder alert. E.g.: If you buy 2 kg. of apples, you can get half a kilo for half the price.
- **Lot**: it accepts the addition of a lot number to a PLU.
- **Tare**: it allows you to discount the container's weight, and to get the net weight of those products that need a container or a package to be weighted or delivered.
      
* * *

- **Prices**: it allows you to define the value of a product in a price list.

* * *

- **Advanced**: it allows you to complete information related to the products' own characteristics, their traceability and supplier. It is also possible to establish the printing formats.
  - **Ingredients**: It allows you to predefine the list of elements that comprise a product.
  - **Data of preservation**: It allows you to specify a list of usage/ preservation recommendations for the products (E.g. temperature, humidity, stowage, etc.).
  - **Nutritional table’s Spreadsheet **: it allows you to visualize and select nutritional tables that had already been created.
  - **Nutritional table data**: it allows you to create the product's nutritional table.
  - **General purpose additional data (bis)**: product's additional information
  - **Image for printing**:  it allows you to link a lineal image to the product that can be visualized in the printed ticket.
  - **Printing formats**: it allows you to select/opt for two kinds of printing formats. This option is only used when it is necessary to define a different format to the preset one.
        - a. Direct sale: printing format that it is issued when selling a product to a client.
        - b. Pre-packed: this mode allows you to label:
            - several products with the same code successively or
            - products that are weighted out of the clients' sight (regulation nutritional information act)
   - **Traceability of meat**: it allows to register the elements referred to the history of the animal from the beginning to the end of the commercialization chain.
   - **Supplier's information**: it allows you to see relevant information about the suppliers.
        
* * *

- **Bar code**: it allows you to select the printing of one or more bar codes according to the business' needs.

* * *

- **Dates**: it allows you to establish the sell by date and time of the product manually (when selling a product) or you can use the format offered by the equipment. This information can be visualized in the printed label.
          
* * *

- **Auditing**: It allows you to see the information related to the registry of the data saved.
