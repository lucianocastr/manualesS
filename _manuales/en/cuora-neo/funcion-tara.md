This function allows you to discount the container's weight, and to get the net weight of those products that need a container or a package to be weighted or delivered.

The function <i class= "systel-tecla-13"/> can be used in two different ways (direct or manual):

- **Direct**: follow the instructions here and the scale will save the container's weight as a tare value.

1. Check that the weight display is at ZERO ( display at zero and the Zero indicator on).
2. Place the empty container.
3. Press TARE: the display will go back to ZERO (Tare indicator on).
4. Place the product.
5. The value you can see on the display corresponds to the "net weight" of the product.

TARE function will activate only when the weight is stable on the platter. To delete a TARE weight, empty the platter and press the TARE key again.

##### Accumulation TARE: Successive tares:

The TARE function can be also used to weight different products without needing to empty the platter. 
For that, place the first product on the platter and use the sales' functions required, press the TARE key and repeat the operation as many times as necessary. Every time you press the TARE key the weight display will come back to zero.

{: .alert-message .note}
Remember that the TARE limit is defined by the equipment's capacity, said information is found printed in the display.
TARE function can only be deactivated taking all the weight out of the platter.
