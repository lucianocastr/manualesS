The ZERO fine adjust can correct small differences in the equipment's readings.
These can be due to some dirt on the platter, air currents,or in the case the equipment had been turned on with some weight on the platter.

To adjust the equipment's zero you just have to remove all the weight that it is on the platter and press the key <i class= "systel-tecla-14"/>

{: .alert-message .warning}
Remember that the maximum limit to use the ZERO fine adjust is 3% of the equipment's maximum capacity.
For an equipment whose maximum weight capacity is 15Kg, the action limit of the ZERO key is from -450 g to +450 g *
For an equipment whose maximum weight capacity is 30Kg, the action limit of the ZERO key is from -900 g to +900 g *

* Metrology legislation in some countries (e.g. Uruguay) admits the automatic use of ZERO function for positive errors.
